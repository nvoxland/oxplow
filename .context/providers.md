# External providers

A provider is a program oxplow talks to — an issue tracker's bridge, a
docs system's — that implements one of oxplow's capabilities (work items
first) outside the app (P5.D, `target-architecture.md` §10). This doc
covers the protocol (D1); the fake provider (D2), the host with its
consent and spawn rules (D3), instances and health (D4) and the
conformance kit (D5) extend it as they land.

## The protocol (`crates/oxplow-provider-protocol`)

**JSON-RPC 2.0 over NDJSON on stdio**: one message per line
(`codec::Message` — request, response, error, notification). A small,
symmetric `Peer` (`peer.rs`) is both sides' connection: `start` /
`request` / `call` (typed) send a request and await its reply through an
outstanding-id table, `notify` and `cancel` send notifications, `respond`
answers the other side, and whatever isn't a reply arrives on the
`Incoming` channel. Ids are the sender's own, from 1. When the stream
ends, replies still awaited fail. It is deliberately not the
`agent-client-protocol` layer: that one is ACP-typed and actor-heavy.

**Notifications about an in-flight request:** `$/cancel { id }` (host →
provider: stop; it answers `Cancelled`), `$/progress { id, message?,
fraction? }`, `$/record { id, entity, row }` (a `read`'s rows, streamed
before its result) and `$/state { id, state }` (a read's checkpoint, the
cursor the next read resumes from).

**The meta-model** (`model.rs`) — Rust types defined once (serde +
schemars), host → provider:

| method | params → result | |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | `InitializeParams { protocol_version, host }` → `InitializeResult { protocol_version, provider, capabilities, commands, event_types, collectors, config_schema }` | what the provider is and declares: `CapabilityDecl { capability, features }`, `CommandDecl { name, summary, input_schema, confirm, effect, undoable }`, `EventTypeDecl { type, v, schema }`, `CollectorDecl { name, entity, description }` |
| `check` | `CheckParams { config, credentials }` → `CheckResult { problems, handle? }` | validate an instance's config (credentials by name — the values stay in the keychain and reach the provider through its environment); `Problem { path, message }`; a clean check returns the opaque `Handle` the other calls carry |
| `discover` | `{ handle }` → `DiscoverResult { entities }` | the entities the instance can read (`EntityDecl { name, description, schema }`) |
| `invoke` | `InvokeParams { handle, command, input }` → `InvokeResult { result, events, inverse? }` | run a declared command; the host logs its `EventDraft { type, v, payload, subject }`s |
| `read` | `ReadParams { handle, collector, state? }` → `ReadResult { records }` | run a collector, streaming `$/record` and `$/state` first |
| `shutdown` | → `null` | |

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` is `"1"`.

**Errors** (`errors.rs`): JSON-RPC's standard codes plus
`NotConfigured` (-32001), `Auth` (-32002), `RateLimited` (-32003,
`data.retry_after_ms`), `InvalidInput` (-32004, `data.field`) and
`Cancelled` (-32800). `ProtocolError` is the typed form; the conversion
keeps the data both ways.

**Schema goldens** (`schemas/<name>.json`, one per wire type — the
methods' params and results, the four notifications, the error object):
`tests/schemas.rs` keeps each equal to the schema generated from its Rust
type and every file owned by a wire type (the `event_schemas.rs`
discipline; `OXPLOW_BLESS=1` writes a new one). A shipped wire shape is a
contract: change it by bumping `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. `schemas::validate`
checks a message against its golden (`for_message` picks it by method),
which the conformance kit runs on every message. Generating TypeScript
bindings for what the UI shows comes with the host (D3/D4); there is no
stub generation for provider authors.
